## The Ping\-O\-Mat


</div>

### Description

this is a useful ping program for networks and internet. its code is highly improved, and if an error occurs, it will tell you what went wrong. you can even specify the text to use for the ping

sorry for my previous mistake. the bas module is included now
 
### More Info
 
if you specify a too long text to ping, it could happen, that your system runs out of memory. the textbox is limited to 255 chars, but on low memory systems it could still happen.
